.. Description of project goes here. This file will also be slurped by setup.py
    and used as long_description, which means this will be the home page on
    PyPI.

Chephren is an extension for `Sphinx`_ that adds features for managing static
websites that are not software documentation. Sphinx is a great tool for
documenting software projects, but it is missing some common features that
would make it just as good for managing static websites. Features provided by
Chephren include:

* Marking a distinction between "posts" and utility pages like the search or about page
* RSS feeds for your posts
* Date-based Archive page for your posts
* A category system with category pages
