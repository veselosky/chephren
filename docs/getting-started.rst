Getting Started with Chephren
===============================

Here's a quick guide to using Chephren to manage a blog.

Creating Blog Posts
==========================

Use the ``article`` directive in any document to make it a blog post.

.. rst:directive:: .. article:: YYYY-MM-DD

    Marks the document as an article to be added to the chronological index.
    The date argument must be in :RFC:`3339` format (the One True Date
    Format). If desired, you may also include a time component.

You can add categories or tags to your blog post by passing them as options
to the ``article`` directive. ::

    .. article:: 2015-03-17
        :category: Holidays
        :tags: St. Patrick's Day

To define a description or summary to be used in your feed, in search results,
and in social media posts, include the description as content in the
``article`` directive. ::

    .. article:: 2015-03-17
        :category: Holidays
        :tags: St. Patrick's Day

Creating Category Pages and Date Archive Pages
====================================================

Chephren uses Sphinx's indexing mechanism to generate archive pages. They will
be created automatically as long as the setting ``html_domain_indices`` is set
to a true value. To control which kinds of archive pages to generate, set
``html_domain_indices`` to a list of the ones you want.

To get separate pages for each category or each month, set
``html_split_index`` to a true value.

The indexes are rendered using the ``domainindex.html`` template, which you
can override in your theme.

Creating a Site RSS Feed
====================================================

A site feed will be generated by default. To suppress it, set
``feed_filename`` to an empty string or ``None``.

To adjust the number of items included in the feed, set ``max_feed_items``.
The default is to include all articles.

By default, the feed includes title and description, but not the full content
of the article. To include full content as well, set ``feed_content`` to a
true value.
