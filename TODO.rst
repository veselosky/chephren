TODO
==================================

* Fix title extraction in `archive` references.
* Paginate the Atom feed.
* Auto-generate a toctree so previous and next work as expected.
* Change the XREF node on indexes to be normal type and not "code".
* Produce per-category pages, possibly by making domain indices honor the
  "split" setting. How do we keep the date archive as one while splitting
  categories?
* Allow a date format to govern date displays.
* Implement "teases"
* Implement traditional-looking reverse-chronological blog home page. How?
* Allow custom layout template per page.
* Allow custom name for archive pages. Possible?
